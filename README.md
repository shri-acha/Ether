A statically typed functional programming language highly based on rust and haskell.

Currently is only implemented with minimal functionalities, has *major vibecoded portions* , will try to rewrite in the future.

Features:
- Has support for strongly typed enums.
- Functions are first class citizens, so have support for storing, returning and working with functions. (Not totally implemented).
- Support for haskell-like lambda support.
- Based on LLVM, so has strong optimization passes.
